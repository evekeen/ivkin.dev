I quit my job a week ago. It's ironic because I'm Russian, and it's probably the worst possible time right now to be unemployed if you are Russian. Because of the war.  

However, the decision has been made, and now I enjoy the freedom of being in charge of my own life. The sense of responsibility goes along with the strong desire to just take a break and do as little as possible enjoying free time.

All I want to do is to create many beautiful products for people. I want to experiment, test multiple ideas and eventually ship something good.
Yesterday I finished my application to YC, today I'm going to work on my app [Ace Trace](https://acetrace.app) from a coworking with a friend.  
It's time to learn, and it's time to meet new people. I'm excited!
