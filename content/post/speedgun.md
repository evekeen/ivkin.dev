I've recently started practising playing tennis. I used to play tennis when I was in high school, however I had to finish my career after just one year because of my wrist injury. Now I decided to give it another change, with my left arm this time, and so far I love it!  
And as usual I immediately started looking for product ideas around tennis to create. Comparing to my previos niche sport disc golf, tennis has a lot more people playing it, and a lot more products available already on the market. However, it looks like there is no affordable speed gun available. The cheapest option on Amazon starts from $99 and a good one is $344. I think I can create an app to do that for $15.  
However, let's do a research first.
