[MIT reality hack](https://www.mitrealityhack.com/) is about to start in a couple of days, and I'm excited to join many talented people to build something amazing this week!  
It's time to get a fresh glance on the AR technology, it must have developed significantly since my last project. I've created a prototype of a [VR frisbee game](https://github.com/evekeen/vrfrisbee), that allows your to throw virtual frisbees, that fly as they would fly in a real world. Originally I wanted to re-create the Ultimate Frisbee experience in the VR world, since all the league were closed because of the pandemic.

However, the frisbee time has passed, and now it's time for new experiments.
