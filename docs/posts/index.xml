        <description>I quit my job a week ago. It&amp;rsquo;s ironic because I&amp;rsquo;m Russian, and it&amp;rsquo;s probably the worst possible time right now to be unemployed if you are Russian. Because of the war.
However, the decision has been made, and now I enjoy the freedom of being in charge of my own life. The sense of responsibility goes along with the strong desire to just take a break and do as little as possible enjoying free time.</description>
