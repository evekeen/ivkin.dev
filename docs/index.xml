        <description>For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been working non-stop on two things:
Finding product-market-fit for Ace Trace Searching for like-minded people to build a new company together. For the Ace Trace my main focus was:
UX improvements to increase the value of the product and hopefully retention Experimenting with the pricing and purchase options to allow more users to enjoy the app on one hand, and to target professional users separately to offer premium features for a higher price Delivering the automatic tracking feature for disc golf users to increase the value of the app, and enable B2B sales in the future.</description>

      <title>San Francisco Startup Conference</title>

        <description>What makes Silicon Valley a unique place?
It’s supposed to not have seasons and very high prices - that’s what I was told all the time. And what about big Californian taxes?
However, for some reason, I always see this place in a completely different light.
Day 0 I flew from sunny Boston to rainy San Francisco. And it’s not a joke, apparently, I managed to choose the worst possible week to fly there, which is technically not my fault - I was only trying to attend a conference.</description>

      <title>Matrices and camera pose estimation</title>

        <description>Camera pose estimation One of the essential features of Ace Trace app (a video editor) is to figure the camera motion as well as zoom changes. This enables the app to pin an object trajectory to a certain point in the physical world coordinate system vs working in the camera viewport.
The process of estimation of the camera pose is called SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping), and here we&amp;rsquo;re are going to talk specifically about Visual SLAM, meaning that we&amp;rsquo;re only using the visual information to estimate the camera pose.</description>

        <description>Phew! 5 days have passed, and it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s been a year, and at the same time, I cannot believe it&amp;rsquo;s already the next week. Weird but fun time travel experience!
I decided to join a project about a pitch training game. The idea is to make it fun to practice pitch recognition, which is essential for musicians of all sorts. The team was a fun group of very different people:</description>

      <title>Getting ready for MIT Reality Hack</title>

        <description>MIT reality hack is about to start in a couple of days, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to join many talented people to build something beautiful this week!
It&amp;rsquo;s time to get a fresh glance at the AR technology - it must have developed significantly since my last project. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a prototype of a VR frisbee game that allows you to throw virtual frisbees that fly as they would fly in the real world.</description>

      <title>I quit my job</title>

        <description>I quit my job a week ago. It&amp;rsquo;s ironic because, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the worst possible time right now to be unemployed if you are from where I am. Because of the war.
However, the decision has been made, and now I enjoy the freedom of being in charge of my own life. The sense of responsibility goes along with the strong desire to just take a break and do as little as possible enjoying free time.</description>
