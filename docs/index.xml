        <description>Phew! 5 days have passed, and it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s been a year, and at the same time, I cannot believe it&amp;rsquo;s already the next week. Weird but fun time travel experience! I decided to join a project about a pitch training game. The idea is to make it fun to practice pitch recognition, which is essential for musicians of all sorts. The team was a fun group of very different people with the idea owner from Berkley music college.</description>

        <description>MIT reality hack is about to start in a couple of days, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to join many talented people to build something beautiful this week!
It&amp;rsquo;s time to get a fresh glance at the AR technology - it must have developed significantly since my last project. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a prototype of a VR frisbee game that allows you to throw virtual frisbees that fly as they would fly in the real world.</description>

      <title>I quit my job</title>

        <description>I quit my job a week ago. It&amp;rsquo;s ironic because, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the worst possible time right now to be unemployed if you are from where I am. Because of the war.
However, the decision has been made, and now I enjoy the freedom of being in charge of my own life. The sense of responsibility goes along with the strong desire to just take a break and do as little as possible enjoying free time.</description>
