        <description>MIT reality hack is about to start in a couple of days, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to join many talented people to build something amazing this week!
It&amp;rsquo;s time to get a fresh glance on the AR technology, it must have developed significantly since my last project. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a prototype of a VR frisbee game, that allows your to throw virtual frisbees, that fly as they would fly in a real world.</description>

      <title>I quit my job</title>

        <description>I quit my job a week ago. It&amp;rsquo;s ironic because I&amp;rsquo;m Russian, and it&amp;rsquo;s probably the worst possible time right now to be unemployed if you are Russian. Because of the war.
However, the decision has been made, and now I enjoy the freedom of being in charge of my own life. The sense of responsibility goes along with the strong desire to just take a break and do as little as possible enjoying free time.</description>
