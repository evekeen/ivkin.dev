        <description>Camera pose estimation One of the essential features of Ace Trace app (a video editor) is to figure the camera motion as well as zoom changes. This enables the app to pin an object trajectory to a certain point in the physical world coordinate system vs working in the camera viewport.
The process of estimation of the camera pose is called SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping), and here we&amp;rsquo;re are going to talk specifically about Visual SLAM, meaning that we&amp;rsquo;re only using the visual information to estimate the camera pose.</description>

I decided to join a project about a pitch training game. The idea is to make it fun to practice pitch recognition, which is essential for musicians of all sorts. The team was a fun group of very different people:</description>

        <description>MIT reality hack is about to start in a couple of days, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to join many talented people to build something beautiful this week!
It&amp;rsquo;s time to get a fresh glance at the AR technology - it must have developed significantly since my last project. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a prototype of a VR frisbee game that allows you to throw virtual frisbees that fly as they would fly in the real world.</description>
