        <description>For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been working non-stop on two things:
Finding product-market-fit for Ace Trace Searching for like-minded people to build a new company together. For the Ace Trace my main focus was:
UX improvements to increase the value of the product and hopefully retention Experimenting with the pricing and purchase options to allow more users to enjoy the app on one hand, and to target professional users separately to offer premium features for a higher price Delivering the automatic tracking feature for disc golf users to increase the value of the app, and enable B2B sales in the future.</description>

        <description>What makes Silicon Valley a unique place?
It’s supposed to not have seasons and very high prices - that’s what I was told all the time. And what about big Californian taxes?
However, for some reason, I always see this place in a completely different light.
Day 0 I flew from sunny Boston to rainy San Francisco. And it’s not a joke, apparently, I managed to choose the worst possible week to fly there, which is technically not my fault - I was only trying to attend a conference.</description>
